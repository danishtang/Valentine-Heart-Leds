Hello everyone, my name is Danish, and I am a first-year Electrical Engineering student.
This is my first Arduino project, using basic code I learned in school. I know this code can be written in a better and shorter way, but this is truly what I studied as a beginner.
Most of this code uses the "for" loop and digitalWrite command.
I believe this project is not only good practice for beginners like me but also a great gift for your girlfriend. ðŸ˜ƒ
